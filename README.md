A simple practice of neural networks based on Tom Michell's [work](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tom/faces.html).

**backprop.h** supports three layer fully connected feedforward networks, using the backpropagation algorithm for weight tuning. Provides high level routines for creating training and using networks.

Modify the c-style backpropagation learning algorithm to c++, which can be used by simply including the header file **backprop.h**.
